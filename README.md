# Typed Pure Functional Programming

This repository will contain a curriculum, teaching materials, and exercises to teach fundamentals
of type pure functional programming.

The basis of the materials revolves around promoting intentional practice via many exercises with open
ended questions asking the learner to reason why something is or is not the case based on principles
and concepts introduced in earlier parts.

The order of the curriculum can be varied to suit each learner's current background and learning
goals to some degree but your mileage may vary (YMMV).

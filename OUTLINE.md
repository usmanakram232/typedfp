# Typed Functional Programming

Proposed outline for internal course with exercises:

* Equational Reasoning Intro
* Lambda Calculus Primitives
* Algebraic Data Types (Optional and List definitions)
  * Holes & Zippers (differentiation on the ADT)
  * ADTs as initial algebras
  * "Zero"
  * Sum types as "addition"
  * Product types as "multiplication"
  * Recursive types as powers
  * Laws (add to zero, mutliply by zero, multiple by one, ...)
  * Equivalences
  * Functions as Exponents
  * To polynomial representations
* Representations (Generic Programming)
  * Simple exercises in traversing structures of common type forms
* Universal & Existential Types
* Logic & Curry-Howard Isomorphism
* Parametricity "theorems for free" (basics)
* Case Study: Sets (much more fleshed out example than given on Friday that relates back to all the prior ideas and concepts in some fashion)
* Foldable, Traverable
* Functors (covariant, show why Set is not a law abiding covariant)
* Contravariant Functors, Bifunctors, Profunctors
* Applicative, Alternative, Arrows, Monads
* Optics: Iso, Fold, Lenses, Traversals, Prisms, Choice, ... (tons of example usages)
* Coyoneda (return to Sets for map :)) & Lawless Popular Misconceptions
* Free Structures (examples: a free monoid, a free applicative, a free monad)
* Extensible Effects
* GADTS
* Case Study: Crypto FFI (Browser and Node bindings)
* Fixed Points!
* Recursion Schemes
* Functional Dependencies

[Insert numberous type-level and dependent type stuff here which may or may not be able to be done in PureScript.]
